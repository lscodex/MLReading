# Person Reading Speed  
this project will make it easier for you to keep your reading data.

# Will be added in the future
- shortcut buttons for start and stop timer
- ML algorithm for training and prediction.


# Will come soon
- run on windows10
- adding menus that working on python ( the menus works on windows10)
- create own data that machine learning predict user reading time


# a formula that calculate words per second WPM
wpm = words on page / seconds to read page * 60 
# values for wpm 
200-250 - > slow
250-280 - > average
280-300 - > high average (a few readers are here)
300-400 - > fast
400+ - > extreme rare
